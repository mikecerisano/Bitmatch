# BitMatch Development Guide

Read [docs/THESIS.md](docs/THESIS.md) for what BitMatch promises and the current plan, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the code is laid out. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) has the platform rules every change follows. This guide covers building, testing, debugging and releasing.

## Building

- Xcode 16 or newer; CI uses Xcode 16.4. Open `BitMatch.xcodeproj`.
- Schemes:
  - `BitMatch`: the macOS app (macOS 15.5 or newer).
  - `BitMatch-iPad`: the iPhone and iPad app (iOS/iPadOS 18.5 or newer). Despite the name it targets both device families.
- Both apps compile everything under `Shared/`. There are no Swift package dependencies. Targets build in Swift 5 language mode; the two app targets use `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = targeted`.
- For an iPhone or iPad device build, set your development team in Signing & Capabilities.

## Where changes go

- **The engine and its rules** live in `Shared/Core/Services/` and `Shared/Core/Models/`: copy, verify, safety, readiness (`TransferReadiness`), what may be chosen (`DestinationSelectionPolicy`, `BackupTargetPolicy`), the verdict (`ResultOutcome`), and the one state owner, `SharedAppCoordinator`.
- **Screens** live in `Shared/Views/`. Each draws a pure presentation value (`*Presentation` in `Shared/Core/Models/`) and decides nothing itself. Put a new rule in the presentation or model, with a test, not in a view.
- **Platform code** stays in `BitMatch/` (Mac) or `BitMatch-iPad/` and `Platforms/iOS/` (iPhone and iPad), and should be limited to what only that platform can do: pickers, drag and drop, panels and share sheets, Disk Arbitration and volume monitoring, SFTP (Mac only). Shared screens take these as slots or closures (`SetupLocationsPlatform`, `MasterReportPlatform`, the `CoordinatorSetupScreen` slots).
- Files in `Shared/` must compile on both platforms. Wrap AppKit or UIKit use in `#if os(...)`.

### Transfer safety boundary

Safety checks belong in the shared engine, not only in views. Readiness on Setup explains a problem early, but `SharedFileOperationsService` and `SafetyValidator` must still refuse an unsafe source or backup when called directly, and `BackupTargetPolicy` must guard every path that adds a backup.

Required behavior (see `Shared/Core/Services/File/SafetyValidator.swift`, `FileCopyService.swift`, `BackupTargetPolicy.swift`, and `Shared/Core/Services/SharedFileOperationsService.swift`):

- never write to the source; never overwrite an existing destination file
- copy to a temporary file and publish it only after sync, a size check and a source-stability check, without replacing anything (hard link, or an exclusive name claim on exFAT/FAT)
- refuse output roots that collide with the source, each other, symlinks, files or nested folders
- include hidden files and empty folders; skip symlink entries
- use uncached checksums for live verification and evidence
- write result status only through `ResultOutcome`; a Quick copy is never "verified"

### Execution path

Platform views present the selection and readiness. Start (the button and ⌘R) calls `SharedAppCoordinator.startCurrentMode()`, which builds a `CopyVerifyConfig` for `CopyVerifyExecutor`. The executor owns timing, error tracking, result coalescing, the sleep assertion, ASC MHL and report handoff, and the verdict. It calls `SharedFileOperationsService`, which runs the real preflight and transfer. Do not add a platform-only transfer path, and do not rely on UI validation as the safety boundary.

Live progress and per-file rows reach views through `LiveProgressFeed` and `LiveResultsFeed`, not through the coordinator's `objectWillChange`. A view that draws live progress or rows observes the feed directly; do not republish per-tick values on `SharedAppCoordinator`.

## Testing

Run the named jobs from the repository root:

```bash
bash test.sh mac-test        # BitMatchTests on macOS
bash test.sh mac-build       # macOS Debug build
bash test.sh ipad-build      # iOS simulator Debug build (the shared-code gate)
IOS_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION='platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad (A16)' bash test.sh ipad-test
bash test.sh release-builds  # macOS and iOS simulator Release builds
```

`ipad-test` refuses to guess a simulator; set `IOS_SIMULATOR_DESTINATION` to one installed on your machine. Set `DERIVED_DATA_ROOT` to reuse a build folder (default `.derived-data/`).

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines `mac-test` and `ipad-build` jobs on push and pull request. The README notes that GitHub Actions is currently disabled for the repository, so run both locally before submitting changes.

### Change workflow

1. Read the shared path before changing copy, verification, preflight, state, readiness or report behavior.
2. Add or update a focused test in `BitMatchTests` (or `BitMatch-iPadTests` for iOS-only behavior). Tests that guard a rule carry a **Plant:** comment: a one-line production change that must make them fail. Try it, see the test fail, revert.
3. Run `bash test.sh mac-test`.
4. Run `bash test.sh ipad-build` after every change to shared code or a presentation model.
5. For UI changes, check an iPhone width (under 600 pt), an iPad split view (600–959 pt) and a Mac window from its 580 pt minimum to wide. Say which checks ran in a simulator and which on a device.
6. Run `bash test.sh release-builds` before release work.
7. Automated tests are not proof of physical-media safety. Use the scripts below and `docs/HARDWARE_TESTING.md`, with throwaway data, when a change can affect transfer reliability.

### Useful test helpers

- `BitMatchTests/TestHelpers/FakeFileSystemService.swift`: the one fake `FileSystemService`.
- `DisposableTransferFixture` and `TestFixtures`: real temporary folders.
- `CameraCardLayouts`: folder trees for camera cards.
- `SharedCoordinatorTestSupport`: builds a `SharedAppCoordinator` for tests.
- `WorkflowSnapshotTests` (both test targets) render the real screens with seeded data. They are skipped unless `BITMATCH_CAPTURE_WORKFLOW_SNAPSHOTS=1` is set.

### Coverage

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme BitMatch -enableCodeCoverage YES -resultBundlePath coverage.xcresult
xcrun xccov view --report coverage.xcresult
xcrun xccov view --report --json coverage.xcresult
```

### Reliability diagnostics and hardware testing

- `Scripts/run_apfs_fault_tests.sh` creates and removes a marked, disposable APFS image, then checks the case in which one destination becomes inaccessible while another succeeds.
- `Scripts/run_soak_tests.sh` runs repeatable transfer stress. Set `BITMATCH_SOAK_SEED` and `BITMATCH_SOAK_ITERATIONS` to reproduce a failure; the defaults are `20260711` and `25`. It prints validated JSON before removing its marked temporary folder.
- `Scripts/ascmhl/validate_reference.sh` checks generated ASC MHL against the official reference tooling.
- For cable removal, sleep, low-power hubs, exFAT and other physical-media cases, follow [docs/HARDWARE_TESTING.md](docs/HARDWARE_TESTING.md) and record results in [docs/HARDWARE_COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/HARDWARE_COMPATIBILITY.md). The automated APFS and exFAT disk-image tests do not prove that real hardware faults are safe.

## Debug tools (Mac)

Debug builds of the Mac app have a **Developer** menu (`BitMatch/App/BitMatchApp.swift`, `#if DEBUG`):

- **Open Interface Lab** (⌥⌘L): launches a second app instance with `--interface-lab`, a no-I/O visual harness with its own sample screens (`BitMatch/Views/InterfaceLab/`).
- **Enable/Disable Dev Mode** (⌥⌘D). The items below need Dev Mode on.
- **Fill Test Data** (⌥⌘T): fills in a sample source, backups and detected camera.
- **Stress Test (Small / Medium / Large)**: runs a real copy between generated folders in the temp directory.
- **Verbose Dev Logs.**
- **Clear All Data**: resets the last operation's results and state.

`DevModeManager` (`BitMatch/Core/Services/DevModeManager.swift`) implements them. None of this exists in Release builds. iPhone and iPad have no debug menu.

## Debugging notes

- **Folder picking on iOS does nothing.** `IOSFileSystemService` retains its document-picker delegate (`currentDelegate`) until the picker finishes; check that it is still retained and that the picker is presented from a valid view controller. Look for "SWIFT TASK CONTINUATION MISUSE" in the console.
- **File access denied on iOS.** Every scan, size check and copy must hold security-scoped access, released with `defer`. See `IOSFileSystemService` and `SharedAppCoordinator.executeOperation`.
- **A backup is refused on a device but not in the simulator.** Simulator paths sit under the Mac's `/Users`; device Files locations sit under `/private/var/mobile`. `SafetyValidator.isProtectedSystemPath` treats that as user storage on iOS only (`BitMatch-iPadTests/IOSStoragePathTests.swift`).
- **A view does not update.** State that drives UI should be `@Published` on `SharedAppCoordinator` or a model it forwards, except live progress and rows, which views observe on `LiveProgressFeed`, `LiveResultsFeed` or `ProgressPresentationModel` directly.
- **Concurrency.** Do heavy file-system enumeration off the main actor and marshal results back. Do not iterate `NSDirectoryEnumerator` with `for in` inside async code; use `while let url = enumerator.nextObject() as? URL`. Do not call actor-isolated methods from nonisolated initializers.
- **Logging.** Use `SharedLogger`. `AppLogger` (Mac) forwards to it.

## macOS release

Prerequisites: a Developer ID Application certificate for the release team, and a notarytool profile named `bitmatch-notary` (override with `NOTARY_PROFILE`).

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials bitmatch-notary \
  --apple-id "APPLE_ID_EMAIL" \
  --team-id "AUJW7AGG26" \
  --password "APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD"

Scripts/release_mac.sh 0.1.7
```

The script builds, signs, notarizes, staples and checksums `dist/BitMatch-<version>.dmg` with a matching `.sha256`. `SKIP_NOTARIZE=1 Scripts/release_mac.sh <version>` checks signing and DMG creation without submitting to Apple. iPhone and iPad are build-from-source for now.

## Conventions

- Keep shared vs platform boundaries: no AppKit or UIKit in shared files outside `#if os(...)`.
- Main-actor correctness for anything that touches UI; progress callbacks reach the coordinator on the main actor.
- New copy or verify behavior has tests for overwrite, source change, hidden files, symlinks and reporting.
- Use `BitMatchError` or `FileOperationError` for user-facing errors, with a message that says what to do.
- No naked TODOs in committed code: write "Future enhancement:" with intent, or file an issue.
- Cancel does not delete copied files. Cancel-time cleanup stays disabled until the pipeline has more field validation.
- Do not replace screenshots with mocks, stale simulator images, or views that show personal paths or media.
