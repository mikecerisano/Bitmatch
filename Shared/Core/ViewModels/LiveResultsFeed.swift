/// row arrives for every file on every backup (and again when it verifies),
/// so it lives outside `SharedAppCoordinator`'s `objectWillChange`, as
/// `LiveProgressFeed` does for progress: the Mac, iPad and iPhone shells
/// observe the coordinator, and a per-file row must not redraw them. Only
/// the views that list results (the Mac live results table and the shared
/// outcome screen) observe this object.
///
/// These rows are the same storage `SharedAppCoordinator.results` reads and
/// writes, so the outcome screen, the journal and the completion export see
/// exactly what the engine reported. A whole-list write through
/// `coordinator.results` (clear, or the engine's authoritative list at the
/// end of a run) still announces itself on the coordinator.
