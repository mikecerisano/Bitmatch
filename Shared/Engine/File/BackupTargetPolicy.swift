// Shared/Core/Services/File/BackupTargetPolicy.swift
//
// The one rule for what may become a backup, used by every path that adds
// one: the pickers and drag-and-drop, Mac drive discovery, the Mac's
// launch-time restore of last-used backups, queue replay, the debug tools,
// the readiness check and the engine's own preflight.
//
// Where the line is:
//
// - Never, whoever asks: the startup disk itself ("/", which is also what
//   /Volumes/Macintosh HD resolves to), anything under /System (the Data
//   sibling at /System/Volumes/Data, Preboot, Recovery, VM, Update, ...),
//   the root of the boot volume, the root of an internal volume with a
//   system name (Recovery, "Recovery 2", Preboot, ...; any letter case),
//   the root of the source's own volume, and any folder on the source's
//   volume when that volume is removable (a card: Promise 1, the card is
//   sacred). When the volume facts cannot be read, a target that looks to
//   be on the source's volume (same /Volumes mount, or inside the mount
//   the other side reports) is refused unless the facts that can be read
//   show a fixed disk: the check fails closed.
// - A folder the user picks on the internal disk is allowed (the GitHub #8
//   setup: a real backup folder on Macintosh HD), and so is a folder on the
//   same fixed disk as the source (the debug stress test) or in the temp
//   folders, including a disk image mounted there (the APFS fault tests).
// - Restoring last time's backups at launch also refuses anything in the
//   temp folders (a volume mounted there included) and internal volume
//   roots: the stress test's temp folder, or a system volume that an older
//   build auto-added and saved, must not come back. A network share's root
//   (a NAS or SMB share: the volume is not local) is not an internal
//   volume and is restored.
// - Drive discovery adds only whole external or removable volumes, never a
//   system-named one, never a network share, and never the source's
//   volume.
//
// Discovery and restore refuse silently (the callers log); a user's own
// pick gets `message` back to show.
