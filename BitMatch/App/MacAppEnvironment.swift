// MacAppEnvironment.swift - builds the Mac app's state once
//
// SharedAppCoordinator is the only state owner, as on iPad and iPhone. The
// Mac adds three small companions that read from and write to it and keep no
// copy of its state: SFTP off-site backups (the thesis's named Mac
// exception), volume access and backup-drive discovery, and choosing a
// detected camera card as the source.
