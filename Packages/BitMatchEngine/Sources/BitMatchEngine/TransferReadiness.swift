///
/// Rules:
/// - A source, then a backup, must be chosen (`needsSource`,
///   `needsDestination`). Those are next steps, not blockers.
/// - Real findings block: duplicate backups, protected or unsafe backups
///   (`BackupTargetPolicy`, overlap with the source), resolved-folder
///   conflicts, a backup that exists but is not writable, and too little
///   free space. Every backup is checked for space, even one that already
///   has another finding.
/// - Space: a backup needs more than the source size plus
///   `requiredHeadroomBytes` free, exactly what the copy itself requires
///   (`SafetyValidator.validateAvailableSpace`), so "Ready" cannot fail at
///   start. A backup whose capacity cannot be read is left to the runtime.
/// - A source still being analysed waits (`analysing`), after any blocker.
/// - Warnings: Quick mode, and a source that needs more than 70% of a
///   backup's free space.
