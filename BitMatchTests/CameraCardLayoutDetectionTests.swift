/// Camera detection against the card layouts in `CameraCardLayouts`.
///
/// Two kinds of test:
/// - Guards pin detection that is right today. Each names the one-line
///   production change that should make it fail.
/// - `withKnownIssue` tests record detection that is wrong today (see
///   docs/audits/2026-09-25-camera-detection.md). They are strict: when a
///   fix lands, the known issue stops reproducing, the test fails, and the
///   wrapper should be removed so the test becomes a guard.
///
/// Placeholder files are empty. The orchestrator asks Spotlight (mdls)
/// about MP4/MOV/JPG files, and that answer depends on the machine. It now
/// asks only after the card layout has named the brand, and uses the
/// answer only when it names the same brand, so a label on those fixtures
/// still starts with the layout's brand.
